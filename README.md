Iris Flower Classification using Data Science
1. Introduction

The Iris Flower Classification project is one of the most famous beginner-friendly projects in data science and machine learning. It uses the Iris dataset, introduced by the British biologist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, which contains measurements of three species of iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

2. Objective

To understand and analyze the Iris dataset.

To apply data preprocessing, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

To build and evaluate different machine learning classification models.

To determine the most suitable model for predicting iris flower species.

3. Dataset Details

Species (Target: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

4. Methodology

The project follows a step-by-step Data Science Life Cycle:

Step 1: Data Collection

Load the Iris dataset from sklearn library or from CSV.

Step 2: Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Check for null values, data types, and outliers.

Perform statistical summary (mean, median, std).

Encode categorical labels into numerical values.

Step 3: Data Visualization (EDA)

Plot histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots to understand feature relationships.

Use heatmaps to analyze correlation between features.

Compare species using boxplots and violin plots.

Step 4: Splitting Data

Divide dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Step 5: Model Building

Apply multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Step 6: Model Evaluation

Evaluate models using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Select the best-performing model.

Step 7: Prediction

Input new measurements of iris flowers.

Predict their species using the trained model.

5. Tools & Technologies

6. Expected Results

A trained classification model with high accuracy (95–99%).

A clear understanding of which features are most important (Petal Length & Petal Width are usually the strongest indicators).

Ability to predict iris flower species from new unseen data.

7. Applications

Used as a benchmark dataset for learning classification algorithms.

Helps beginners in understanding the end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
